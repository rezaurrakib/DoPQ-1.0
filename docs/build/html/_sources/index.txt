DoPQ 1.0 documentation!
================================
Welcome! This is the documentation for DoPQ 1.0. It's completely written in Python 3.

DoPQ stands for **DOcker Priority Queue**. It's a software for running complex deep learning models in the form of docker containers on a multi-gpu system. Internally it maintains a priority queue, including a penalty scoring system, hence ensures the balance between occupied gpu's among valid users.

DoPQ Architecture
-----------------
DoPQ is build on MVC design pattern. From a broader perspective, the whole architecture is a **Server** -- **Client** system. **Server** contains a *provider* and a *priority queue* process constantly running for fetching, building docker images and run those in the central gpu-machine. The **Client** part does the trivial job for updating the priority queue's status, including information about running docker containers, history of completed docker images, how many docker containers are currently lined up in the queue for executing etc. It also provides options for sending commands from the client side to server for valid users registered into the DoPQ database.
